# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A simple yet powerful machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This project is perfect for demonstrating fundamental ML workflows and model evaluation techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is part of my machine learning portfolio. It uses the classic **Iris dataset** and implements a supervised learning algorithm to accurately classify flower species.

Key Highlights:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparison of multiple ML algorithms
- Clean, modular code with comments and explanations
